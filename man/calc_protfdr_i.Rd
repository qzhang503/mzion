}
\arguments{
\item{td}{A data frame with paired target-decoys at prot_n_pep = i.}

\item{target_fdr}{Numeric; the levels of false-discovery rate (FDR).}

\item{max_protnpep_co}{A positive integer; the maximum number of peptides
under a protein (\code{prot_n_pep}) to warrant the protein significance.
For instance, proteins with \code{prot_n_pep > max_protnpep_co} will have a
protein significance score cutoff of zero and thus are significant. Choose
\code{max_protnpep_co = Inf} to learn automatically the cut-off from data.
Note that the the value of \code{prot_n_pep} includes the counts of shared
peptides.}

\item{method_prot_es_co}{A low-priority setting. A character string; the
method to calculate the cut-offs of protein enrichment scores. The value is
in one of \code{"median", "mean", "max", "min"} with the default of
\code{"median"}. For instance at the default, the median of
\code{peptide_score - pep_score_cutoff} under a protein will be used to
represent the threshold of a protein enrichment score. For more conserved
thresholds, the statistics of \code{"max"} may be considered.}

\item{n_burnin}{The minimum number of burn-ins in protein enrichment scores.}

\item{out_path}{An output path.}
}
\value{
A score cut-off at a given prot_n_pep.
}
\description{
For prot_n_pep at value i.
