\title{Concatenates adjacent peptides in a list (with mass).}
\usage{
roll_sum(peps = NULL, n = 2L, include_cts = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{peps}{A list of peptide sequences with a one-letter representation of
amino acid residues.}

\item{n}{The number of mis-cleavages for consideration.}

\item{include_cts}{Logical; the list, \code{peps}, includes the protein
C-terminal sequence or not. At the default of TRUE, mis-cleaved peptides at
the end of the protein C-terms will be added as they should. The arguments
would be typically at FALSE, for example, when used for generating
mis-cleaved peptides from the N-terminal of peptides with the removal of a
starting residue \code{M}.}
