}
\arguments{
\item{mgfs}{MGF data.}

\item{mgf_path}{The path to MGF files}

\item{quant}{A character string; the quantitation method. The default is
"none". Additional choices include \code{tmt6, tmt10, tmt11, tmt16 and
tmt18}. For other multiplicities of \code{tmt}, use the compatible higher
plexes. For example, apply \code{tmt16} for \code{tmt12} provided a set of
12-plexes being constructed from a 16-plex TMTpro \eqn{(7 * 13C + 2 *
15N)}. It is also possible that an experimenter may construct a
\code{tmt12} from a 18-plex TMTpro \eqn{(8 *13C + 1 * 15N)} where
\code{quant = tmt18} is suitable.}

\item{min_mass}{A positive integer; the minimum precursor mass for
interrogation. The default is an arbitrarily low value (the primary guard
against low molecular-weight precursors is \code{min_len}).}

\item{max_mass}{A positive integer; the maximum precursor mass for
interrogation.}

\item{ppm_ms1_bin}{The tolerance in precursor mass error after mass binning.}

\item{data_type}{The type of peak lists in one of raw, mzML or mgf. The
argument is used to handle list(NULL) at an mzML format.}

\item{n_13c}{Number(s) of 13C off-sets in precursor masses, for example, over
the range of \code{-1:2}. The default is 0.}

\item{is_ms1notched}{Logical; is there an off-set (notch) in MS1 mass.}
